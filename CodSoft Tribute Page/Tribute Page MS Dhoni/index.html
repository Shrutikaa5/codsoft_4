        <p>
          Mahendra Singh Dhoni, commonly known as MS Dhoni and Mahi, is an Indian cricketer player 
          and was a former captain of the Indian cricket team.[1][2] Dhoni is a right-handed batsman.
          The Indian cricket team won the 2011 Cricket World Cup under his captainship. His Test cricket 
          and One Day International records are the best of all Indian captains to date. He took over the 
          ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid in 2007 and led the team to its first ever inter-country ODI 
          series wins in Sri Lanka and New Zealand. Dhoni also holds the post of Vice-President of India 
          Cements Ltd. after resigning from Air India. India Cements is the owner of the Indian Premier 
          League team Chennai Super Kings, and Dhoni has been its captain since the first edition of IPL.[3][4]
          Dhoni was given many awards, such as the ICC ODI Player of the Year award in 2008 and 2009 
          (the first Indian player to achieve this), the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 2007 and the Padma Shri, 
          India's fourth-highest civilian honour, in 2009.On 6 February 2015, Dhoni's daughter was born. 
          He retired from international cricket in 2020.

          <p>He attended school in Shyamali, near Ranchi, Jharkhand. He was an exemplary student-athlete, 
            but he preferred badminton and football. He was his school’s goalkeeper.
            From 1995 to 1998, his football coach sent him to a local cricket club to be a wicketkeeper. 
            This was an accident. He was the Commando cricket club’s regular wicketkeeper during that period.
            From 1997–98, he made the Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship team. After 10th grade, 
            he took cricket seriously.</p>

            <p>Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,
               but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni 
               to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team. His exceptional wicketkeeping 
               skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). 
               Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy 
               Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.</p>

          <summary id="Career" onclick="MClick('Career')">Dhoni's cricket career</summary>
          <p>MS Dhoni entered the international cricket scene in 2004 when he played for India against 
            Bangladesh. Later that year, he was chosen for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. In 2006, he made 
            his Test debut against Sri Lanka and ODI debut against West Indies. He has been a regular member 
            since then. MS Dhoni’s performance in the 2007 T20 World Cup brought him to prominence. He was named 
            team captain for the tournament, leading them to victory against Pakistan in the final. In 2008, he 
            became captain of India’s ODI team as well, thus making him the youngest captain in history.</p>
            <p>He was recognised for his efforts in the 2003/04 season, especially in the One Day format and was 
              picked for the India A squad for a tour of Zimbabwe and Kenya. Against the Zimbabwe XI in Harare Sports 
              Club, Dhoni had his best wicket-keeping effort with 7 catches and 4 stumpings in the match. In the 
              tri-nation tournament involving Kenya, India A and Pakistan A, Dhoni helped India A chase down their 
              target of 223 against Pakistan A with a half-century. Continuing his good performance, he scored back 
              to back centuries – 120[63] and 119*[64] – against the same team. Dhoni scored 362 runs in 6 innings at 
              an average of 72.40 and his performance in the series received attention from the then Indian captain – 
              Sourav Ganguly and Ravi Shastri, amongst others.</p>

            <summary id="Style" onclick="MClick('Style')">Dhoni's Playing Style</summary>
            <p>Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper. Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman. He deviates from 
              conventional coaching manuals and showcases his unique batting technique. Dhoni displays a proclivity 
              for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than 
              the conventional Cover region. Furthermore, he demonstrates remarkable skill in playing pull shots and 
              hook shots off short-pitched deliveries, putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length 
              accordingly. Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force 
              and precision to clear the boundary. Despite this, he still retains the capability to produce awe-inspiring, 
              long sixes. He is known for his unorthodox captaincy and cool-headed demeanor on the field. 
              As a batsman, he is recognized for his remarkable finishing skills in high-pressure situations, and his 
              aggressive captaincy has earned him the reputation of a successful leader in Indian cricket. He has also 
              been renowned for his lightning-fast glove-work behind the stumps.</p>
              <p>Initially, Dhoni appeared as a lower-order attacking batsman but he gradually changed his playing style 
              to deal with high-pressure scenarios and his growing responsibility as a captain. He is a powerful hitter of 
              the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets. He made use of the helicopter shot 
              technique,[166] taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.His wicket-keeping skill is 
              widely praised by cricket experts but also criticised for lack of good technique. He has a world record for the 
              highest number of stumpings by any wicket-keeper. As a captain, Dhoni was approachable to players.
              Former cricketers and opposition players underline that his behaviour on cricket ground was calm and composed. 
              He used to allow his bowlers to set field for themselves.</p>
